      "message": "I have checked your code. Lets be very clear vpd code is different from telemetry code. Our BMC Telemetry is based on redfish specification and so, we are following redfish definitions from the beginning. IBM specific sensors (used in report creation) are hidden and provided by redfish properties and not shown in the code. Even if redfish definitions are there but corresponding sensor definitions not available, it will throw error.\n\nThis fix is based on earlier code and just modified to skip report creation on unavailable attributes and avoid magic number in definition to fix the issue. I am not going to make any unnecessary and unreliable changes at this moment.",
