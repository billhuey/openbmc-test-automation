    # Test Flow:
    #              - Power on
    #              - Establish SSH connection session
    #              - Create HTX mdt profile
    #              - Run HTX exerciser
    #              - Inject network activity on BMC
    #              - Check HTX status for errors
    #              - Shutdown HTX if no error when timer expires

Post Test Case Execution
    [Documentation]  Do the post test teardown.
    # 1. Shut down HTX exerciser if test Failed.
    # 2. Capture FFDC on test failure.
    # 3. Close all open SSH connections.
