# Test Parameters:
# TYPE                EEH error function to use, default is 4.
# OPENBMC_HOST        The BMC host name or IP address.
# OS_HOST             The OS host name or IP Address.
# OS_USERNAME         The OS login userid (usually root).
# OS_PASSWORD         The password for the OS login.
# HTX_DURATION        Duration of HTX run (e.g. "24 hours", "8 hours").
# HTX_INTERVAL        The time delay between consecutive checks of HTX
#                     status, for example, 30 minutes.
#                     In summary: Run HTX for $HTX_DURATION, checking
#                     every $HTX_INTERVAL.
# HTX_MDT_PROFILE     MDT profile to be executed (e.g. "mdt.bu, net.mdt, etc")
#                     default is "mdt.bu".
# bootme_period       Bootme period where the system will be rebooting. (e.g.
#                     "3") 3 = 1 hour period.

# Expected result:
# HTX runs mdt.bu and doesn't log errors during the acceptance execution.

# Glossary:
# MDT:
#   Master device table is a collection of hardware devices on the system for
#   which HTX exercisers can be run.
# build_net:
#   Script that configures every network port when connected to a loop. This
#   skips the communication port to always keep it available.
# mdt.bu:
#   Default mdt file. Collection of all HTX exercisers. Aim is to test entire
#   system concurrently.
# HTX error log file /tmp/htxerr
#   Records all the errors that occur. If there's no error during the test, it
#   should be empty.
# bootme:
#   This configures the cron to reboot the system and re-run the HTX profile.
