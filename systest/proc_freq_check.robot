Get Processor Max Speed Setting
    [Documentation]  Get processor maximum speed setting from the OS.
    # - On the OS run: ppc64_cpu --frequency
    # - Return the max frequency value reported.

    ${command}=  Set Variable
    ...  ppc64_cpu --frequency | grep max | cut -f 2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1
    # The ppc64_cpu --frequency command returns min, max, and average
    # cpu frequencies. For example,
    # min:    2.500 GHz (cpu 143)
    # max:    2.700 GHz (cpu 1)
    # avg:    2.600 GHz
    # The ${command} selects the max: line, selects only the
    # 2.700 GHz (cpu 1) part, then selects the 2.700 number.

    # Get the maximum processor frequency reported.
    ${output}  ${stderr}  ${rc}=  OS Execute Command
    ...  ${command}  print_out=${1}

    ${frequency}=  Convert To Number  ${output}
    [Return]  ${frequency}


Pre Test Case Execution
    [Documentation]  Do the pre test setup.
    # Save the initial system turbo setting.
    # Start (setup) console logging.

    ${initial_turbo_setting}=  Read Turbo Setting Via REST
    Set Suite Variable  ${initial_turbo_setting}  children=true
    Start SOL Console Logging


Post Test Case Execution
    [Documentation]  Do the post test teardown.
    # - Restore original turbo setting on the system.
    # - Capture FFDC on test failure.
    # - Power off the OS and close all open SSH connections.

    Set Turbo Setting Via REST  ${initial_turbo_setting}

    FFDC On Test Case Fail
    Smart Power Off
    Close All Connections
