      "message": "Where is the get that actually returns the completion of the post?  I see Wait For Task Completion is polling the task object, but where is the read of the Task Monitor that returns the actual completion?\n\n\nAs described in the Redfish school for tasks, the task monitor should return 202 while the task is progressing, then return the response as if the http operation was performed synchronously instead of deferred to a task.\n\nAlso, per dmtf 2066 8.3 status codes, the Location header should have a Location header with the URI of the task monitor (see table 14 in 2022.2).  The task representation in the task resource is MAY in table 14, but SHOULD in 12.2 asynchronous operations.  Also there is a Retry-After header in 12.2.\n\nAlso, in general, when not testing the implementation of the task service, it would be useful to have a test that checks the task monitor at the described interval, with some limits for total task execution time.",
