      "message": "Resolved in off-line discussion with Prashanth.\n- Background: without this, the test fails for default root password 0penBmc.\n- Skip, because we check a precondition on an external pararameter, which may not be under our control.  As opposed to a fail because of a hardware or firmware bug.\n- Skipping also allows the Teardown section conditional (line 347), avoiding a secondary fail in Teardown step.\n- User notification is in next line, 343, with further elaboration in comments line 344, 345.",
