      "message": "For release lock ideally there should be only one keyword, there are only 2 outcomes either it\u0027ll release or not-release.\nAgree it may increase few lines or complexity, Let the intelligence or complexity be in one place, rather than having in multiple keywords. At the end it reduces confusion \u0026 complexity of looking into multiple same keywords and reduce lot of lines and makes it more structured.",

Debugging will be same if looked at log.html and more easier if looked at code level.\nEach test case will call this keyword and knows whether it is an error or valid scenario, and pass that param accordingly.\nKeyword has to just use that parameter and either expect error or 200OK while releasing lock.",
