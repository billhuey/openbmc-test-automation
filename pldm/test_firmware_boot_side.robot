Documentation       Test firmware boot side switch using pldmtool.

# Test Procedure:
# 1. Power off the host or post firmware is updated.
# 2. Check the firmware boot side ( login to BMC and execute )
#    Example:
#    pldmtool bios GetBIOSAttributeCurrentValueByHandle -a fw_boot_side
#
#    It should return response either Temp or Perm
# 3. Set the firmware boot side to Temp or Perm accordingly
#    Example:
#    pldmtool bios SetBIOSAttributeCurrentValue -a fw_boot_side -d Temp
#
# 4. Power on
# 5. BMC take reset during power on ( expected )
# 6. Check the system booted to Runtime
# 7. Verify the boot side is still same which was set.
